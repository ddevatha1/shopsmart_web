 * reports (never an OpenStreetMap POI standing in for the retailer) — or
 * `undefined` if that retailer's public APIs genuinely can't resolve one for
 * this ZIP. The returned `StoreLocation.storeId` is what the calling
 * scraper feeds back into its product-search request, so the store that
 * data comes from and the store whose address is shown are always the same.
