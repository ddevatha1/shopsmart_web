/**
 * Aldi's own ordering platform (Instacart-backed) exposes a real
 * "find nearby stores" endpoint at `www.aldi.us/idp/v1/shops?postal_code=`
 * — the same one aldi.us's own storefront calls to power its store picker.
 * It returns real candidate stores *already sorted nearest-first* (verified
 * live: querying a Frisco, TX ZIP returns Frisco, then McKinney, then
 * progressively farther DFW-metro suburbs) — retailer-native distance
 * ranking, not something this app computes. This app trusts that order
 * for *selection*; OpenStreetMap is only used afterward to geocode the
 * selected store's address, since this endpoint doesn't return lat/lng.
 *
 * Each physical store address can appear multiple times in the results
 * with different `fulfillment_option`s (delivery/pickup/instore) — each is
 * a distinct `shopId` even though they share an address. "instore" is what
 * this app's product search actually needs (in-store shelf prices, not
 * delivery/pickup markup), so that's the fulfillment type selected.
