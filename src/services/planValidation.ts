/**
 * Cart Auto-Optimize's re-optimizer resolves each cart item by searching its
 * exact product name as free text — reliable for typical grocery-list
 * terms, but a long/specific name (e.g. "Kroger Lactose Free 2% Reduced Fat
 * Milk Half Gallon") can occasionally text-match into a wrong department
 * entirely. Found live, twice: it first matched a tea product onto "Half
 * Gallon" (both contain "half"), and even the grocery *category* classifier
 * agreed with that wrong match, because the tea's name happened to also
 * contain "Half and Half" — a real dairy product name, coincidentally.
 * Category alone isn't independent enough (same keyword-matching weakness
 * as the search that caused the mismatch), so looksLikeSameProductType also
 * requires the two product NAMES to share an actual significant word. A
 * plan failing either check is rejected outright, never shown with a
 * caveat: this is exactly the kind of mistake "never show misleading
 * savings" exists to catch.
