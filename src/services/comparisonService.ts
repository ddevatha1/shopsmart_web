// ─── Semantic grouping ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Marketing/descriptor words that don't change what the product fundamentally
// is — same spirit as the backend's FILLER_WORDS (app/api/search/route.ts)
// but re-implemented locally, same justification as
// priceHistoryService.normalizeProductName: this is a frontend-only concern
// with no shared runtime with the backend.
//
// 'organic' is included here (unlike an earlier version of this grouping
// key) — real shoppers expect "Organic Fuji Apples," "Family Pack Fuji
// Apples," and "Individual Fuji Apple" to all show up as browsable options
// within the same "Fuji Apples" comparison, not fragment into separate
// Stage-1 categories. A bare, variety-less "Organic Apples" search still
// forms its own group, since nothing here strips the variety word itself
// (fuji/gala/honeycrisp/...) — only the modifiers that describe a variant
// of an already-identified product, not the product's identity.
//
// Also includes cut/format modifiers ("boneless," "skinless," "thin,"
// "thick," "lean") and generic promotional labels ("new," "item,"
// "holiday," "seasonal," "exclusive") — the same closed-class treatment as
// every other word here, not specific to any one product: "Fresh Boneless
// Skinless Chicken Breast," "Family Pack Chicken Breast," and "Thin Sliced
// Chicken Breast" all need to reduce to the same identity as plain
// "Chicken Breast" for cross-store clustering to actually find them as one
// product (see computeIdentity below).
//
// Deliberately does NOT include fat-content/processing words ("whole,"
// "2%," "skim," "reduced fat," ...) or egg qualifiers ("cage-free,"
// "free-range," ...) — those describe materially different products a
// shopper is choosing between, not marketing filler, so each forms its own
// Stage-1 category same as any other variety word (see the fuji/gala note
// above).
